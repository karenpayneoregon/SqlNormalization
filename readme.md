### Required NuGet packages

[Equin.ApplicationFramework.BindingListView](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Equin.ApplicationFramework.BindingListView/)

The BindingListView .NET library provides a type-safe, sortable, filterable, data-bindable view of one or more lists of objects. It is the business objects equivalent of using a DataView on a DataTable in ADO.NET. If you have a list of objects to display on a Windows Forms UI (e.g. in a DataGridView) and want to allow your user to sort and filter, then this is the library to use!
